    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Flatten pork slices, one at a time, by placing in between two pieces of sturdy plastic and pounding with a meat mallet 
            until 1/4-inch thick and about 3 1/2x5 inches in size. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk egg and milk together in a shallow bowl; stir in salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, seasoned salt, marjoram, and oregano until well blended. Place bread crumbs into another shallow bowl. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Dip each flattened cutlet into seasoned egg mixture, then dip into bread crumbs until thoroughly coated. Set breaded cutlets in a single layer on a piece of parchment or waxed paper. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large skillet until shimmering. Gently lower cutlets into the hot skillet and fry until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place kaiser rolls, split-sides up, onto a baking sheet. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Broil in the preheated oven until toasted and hot, about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from the oven and assemble sandwiches: Place fried cutlets on roll bottoms. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Add toppings in the desired order: mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, pickle, onion, tomato, and lettuce. Top sandwiches with roll tops and serve. 
        </li>
    </ol>
